    <p>
        My name is Jack Markwalter, and I am a proud graduate of the University of Notre Dame. After graduation, I worked for an investment company in Tampa, Florida. There, I gained experience investing in a number of asset classes including private equity, real estate, and private debt. I spent the majority of my time working on the private equity side and managing our portfolio companies within the consumer finance space. After two years, I ended up leaving my job in Tampa and moving back to Atlanta in May.

        Upon moving back to Atlanta, I moved to start a company with my brother. Our company is a financial wellness company that partners with employers to offer affordable loans to employees as an employee benefit. We also provide access to financial education and over-the-phoone financial counseling to the employees as partner employers. Our mission is to build an inclusive financial system that rewards hard-working Americans who have demonstrated the ability to keep a job.

        I am now taking this class in order to hone my web development skills. Over the last seven months, I have worked with a team of developers in building out the web application that powers our benefits platform. Through this process, I have seen how important it is to understand the world of coding and how much of a difference it makes for any company in today's day and age even if they are not technically a technology company. Because of this value, I have decided to take this class to learn how to better manage our developer team and potentially even help my company on the coding side of the business.
